    "Abstraction is a process of hiding internal details and showing only important features to users. It helps in managing complexity in a system and provide easy to use interface. For example a car has many features like wheels, engine, etc. A user wants to drive a car doesnot need internal details of car.\n"

It ensures that data cannot accessed  on outside world directly and accessed through methods only.It provide data protection and maintain integrity in data. For example, consider a bank account. A bank account is an encapsulated object that has various data such as account number, account holder name, balance, etc. These data should not be accessible to anyone directly."

    "In Python, the abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a way to define abstract classes that enforce specific method signatures for its subclasses. An abstract class cannot be instantiated, and it is meant to be subclassed by other classes that implement its abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to implement a programming concept called \"polymorphism,\" which allows code to work with objects of different classes in a consistent way. By defining abstract base classes, the abc module helps to ensure that the subclasses implementing the abstract methods have the same interface, which makes it easier to write polymorphic code.\n"
