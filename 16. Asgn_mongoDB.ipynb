    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, instead of using a traditional table-based relational database structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, making them a good choice for handling large amounts of unstructured data such as social media data, logs, and multimedia content. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases are schemaless and can easily scale horizontally by adding more servers, making them more flexible and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for flexible data modeling, where data is unstructured or semi-structured, or where the data schema is frequently changing. MongoDB also supports dynamic queries, indexing, and can handle large amounts of data easily, making it a good choice for Big Data applications. Additionally, MongoDB is often used for real-time applications, such as chat applications, as it can handle a high volume of write operations efficiently.\n",
    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used in modern web applications. The following are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for a more natural representation of complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Performance: MongoDB's architecture is designed to provide high performance and scalability, with support for sharding and replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schema-less: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for more flexibility in the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing: MongoDB supports a variety of indexing options, including secondary indexes, geospatial indexes, and text indexes, to enable fast and efficient querying of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows for advanced data analysis and manipulation, including grouping, sorting, filtering, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-Platform Support: MongoDB supports a wide range of programming languages and platforms, making it a flexible choice for modern web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Availability: MongoDB's architecture is designed for high availability, with support for automatic failover and replica sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible Deployment: MongoDB can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, with support for a variety of deployment options including Docker containers and Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active community of developers and users, with a thriving ecosystem of tools and libraries for integrating MongoDB with other technologies.\n",
    "# Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",

For example, you might use delete_one() to remove a user record when that user closes their account.\n",

For example, you might use delete_many() to remove all expired sessions from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `drop()` - This method is used to drop or delete an entire collection from the database. It is useful when you want to completely remove a collection and all of its data, such as when you are no longer using a particular data model. For example, you might use drop() to remove a collection that is no longer needed after a major system redesign."
