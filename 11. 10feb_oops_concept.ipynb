    "- x: This mode opens the file for exclusive creation, meaning it will fail if the file already exists.\n",

    "# Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened with the open() function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to close a file after you're done using it for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Resource management`: When you open a file in your program, your computer reserves system resources to allow your program to interact with that file. If you don't close the file when you're done with it, these resources will remain in use until your program exits or the file is closed, which can slow down your program or cause errors if you try to open too many files at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data consistency`: When you write data to a file, it's often buffered, meaning it's temporarily held in memory before being written to the file on disk. If you don't close the file, any unwritten data may be lost if your program crashes or the computer loses power. Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is written to disk and that the file is properly updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Security`: If you leave a file open, other programs or processes may be able to access or modify it without your knowledge or permission, which could compromise your program's security.\n"
